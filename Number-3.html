    This scene is of Vegeta sacrificing himself. He was a good guy but then, a wizard put a curse on him that brings the evil out, and to get rid of it, to try and defeat the enemy, also to show that he's no ones "dog" he sacrificed himself, and it was also to save his wife and son, it was the first time he fought for himself.

    It has the #3 spot because it is one the most emotional scenes, it has really great animation, and it's really symbolic because this is where Vegeta becomes a good guy.

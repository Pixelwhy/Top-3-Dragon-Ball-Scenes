      This scene is of Frieza coming back after everyone thought he was defeated, before the clip he mortally wounded Piccolo, and now he killed Krillin, Goku is now insanely angry, he goes so mad, he unlocks one of the most iconic transformations in all of fiction.

      This scene has the #1 spot because it deserves it, it is one of, if not, the most iconic scenes in all of fiction, the way Goku is so tense and mad, the way Frieza knows what's going to happen, what Goku says to Frieza as he's transforming andthe animation is so good.
